"""One-time, run-once data migrations for claude-swap.

A small, boring home for compatibility migrations so they don't pollute the
core switch/read/write flow in :mod:`claude_swap.switcher`. Each migration:

- is **idempotent** and **self-guarded** (safe to run twice, safe even if the
  state file is missing or corrupt),
- returns ``True`` when it *completed* (runner records it as applied),
- returns ``False`` when it was *skipped / not applicable* (runner records
  nothing, so a later-restored backup can still trigger it),
- raises :class:`~claude_swap.exceptions.MigrationIncomplete` (or any other
  exception) when it *partially failed* — the runner logs it and leaves it
  unmarked so the next run retries.

Applied migrations are tracked in ``<backup_dir>/.migrations.json``:

    {"version": 1, "applied": {"windows_keyring_to_files": "<iso-timestamp>"}}

Run once at switcher construction (see ``ClaudeAccountSwitcher.__init__``);
after the state file records a migration it short-circuits with a single tiny
file read and never touches the source backend again.
