"""Snapshot source — the supported read path for dashboards and GUI shells.

Pacing is store-governed: the usage store's persisted poll plans plus its
freshness/backoff/claim gates (decided atomically in ``UsageStore.reserve``)
cap every surface at the same per-account cadence, so a dashboard repainting
every few seconds and a one-shot ``cswap list`` produce identical network
behavior. This class therefore just runs the same on-demand pass as ``cswap
list`` (``fetch=None``) each take — the store decides which accounts, if
any, may actually be fetched — and offers ``store_only`` for shells that
host an auto engine (which already collects on its own schedule).

``take()`` is blocking (file locks, keychain subprocesses, network): call it
from a background thread, never a UI event loop.
