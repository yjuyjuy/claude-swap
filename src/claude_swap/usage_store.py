"""Per-account usage table: last-known-good measurements + fetch/backoff state.

Replaces the all-or-nothing 15s snapshot that previously lived in
``cache/usage.json`` (now ``schemaVersion: 2``; a version-less legacy file is
treated as empty — its data had a 15s shelf life anyway). One failed round
trip no longer blanks every account: a failure updates the error/backoff
fields and never touches the last-good measurement (stale-on-error). The
table is shared by ``--list``/``--status`` (on-demand refresh of stale
entries) and ``cswap auto`` (scheduled polling), so each learns from the
other's fetches.

The store persists only *measurements* (``lastGood``) and *fetch state*
(failures, backoff, poll schedule). Sentinel states ("api key",
"token expired", ...) are derived fresh by the collector on every pass and
overlaid on the read model (``UsageEntry.sentinel``) — never written to disk,
so a stale sentinel can't outlive the condition that produced it.

Locking protocol (never holds the lock across network I/O):
(a) lock → read, decide/claim the fetch set (stamp ``claimUntil``) → unlock;
(b) fetch with no lock held;
(c) lock → re-read, merge outcomes, clear the claim, write → unlock.
The bounded lease lets concurrent collectors skip accounts another process is
still fetching; recording the outcome releases it and a crashed claimer ages
out. The collector records per *batch*, so a fast account's lease is held
until its batch's slowest fetch lands — the lease TTL is sized for the whole
batch, not one request.

# server's own deadline either way. Cumulative polling from cswap's own
# surfaces is what saturates it.
# Retry-After tells the rules apart:
# - "Retry-After: 0" = the saturated-budget edge: the trailing hour's budget
#   is spent and frees only as old requests age out, so immediate retries
#   mostly prolong the oscillating state. Wait at least
#   poll_policy.EDGE_BACKOFF_S before probing again.
# - "Retry-After: N>0" = the burst rule (several rapid requests on one token
#   → hard block; measured: accurate, counts down, not extended by probing).
#   Honored as the wait, up to a safety cap so a pathological header can
#   never park an account for hours.
# The cap spans the usage endpoint's ~1h rolling window: a saturating burst
# blocks the token for up to a full trailing hour, and the server's Retry-After
# reports that horizon accurately — it counts down to a fixed wall-clock
# deadline and is NOT re-armed by probing (measured: three probes in one
# episode all reported the same deadline). Capping below it (the old 900s) just
# meant re-probing two or three times inside a block that was going to last the
# full window anyway — wasted requests against the very budget we are trying to
# let recover, with no benefit. Honoring the whole Retry-After spends one
# request per block instead. The cap still bounds a pathological header to one
# window, never hours.
#
# Honoring it EXACTLY is not enough: the retry lands ON the deadline, where
# the server is not reliably ready. Measured over this machine's whole log
# (re-measured 2026-08-03, round 8 — the round-7 "21 of 36"/"2 of 38" figures
# do reproduce under the method below, on the OTHER of its two valid
# readings; round 8 switched readings, see the METHOD paragraph below for
# which and why the two differ; these figures age as the log grows —
# re-derive rather than trust them verbatim, using the method below), 20 of
# 35 lapses re-blocked within 900s
# of their own deadline (+2s..+887s), each earning a fresh full hour; the
# next one is +1004s, so the distribution is bimodal and 900s is the edge of
# the band — with only 13s of clearance (900 - 887), not the 185s an earlier,
# wrong figure implied. ("20 of 35", not "of 38": the denominator is
# restricted to the 35 POSITIVE lapse gaps, matching the numerator — 3 of the
# 38 raw gaps are negative, and mixing them into an "of 38" denominator
# understates the fraction. The negative gaps are NOT a uniform mechanism —
# measured per gap: acct2 block10→11 (no within-block revision at all, a
# single-observation block whose NEXT block's opening simply lands later);
# block11→12 (the deadline was revised BACKWARD 903s mid-block, the opposite
# of "forward"); block12→13 (deadline unchanged mid-block). None is a forward
# revision. What they share is only the effect, not the cause: each next
# block's opening observation lands before the prior block's own deadline —
# a real event, just not a lapse to measure. Excluding them from a lapse-gap
# analysis is still correct on that basis: a block that never lapsed has no
# lapse gap.) The margin is
# ABSOLUTE, not a fraction of the ask: Retry-After counts down to a fixed
# deadline, so a machine polling into a block another one opened sees only
# the remainder, and a fraction of that shrinks toward zero exactly when it
# matters.
#
# METHOD (re-derive with this, not ad hoc, to get the same numbers): parse
# ``claude-swap.log`` lines "Usage fetch failed for account N: http-429,
# retry-after Ks"; EXCLUDE K == 0 (the saturated-budget edge above, a
# different rule from the burst block this margin is sized against — 439 such
# lines in the 2026-08-03 log, and mixing them into the block counts is what
# produced the earlier wrong figures); group the remaining events per account
# into blocks by clustering on the deadline ``ts + K`` (a new block opens when
# the deadline jumps forward past a tolerance — stable for any tolerance from
# 5s to 300s). 41 blocks result, 40 of them opened at exactly K=3600; 34 of
# 75 observations land mid-block (not block-opening); the lapse gap is each
# block's next observation's timestamp minus the PRIOR block's deadline —
# where a block has more than one observation (a mid-block deadline
# revision), "the block's deadline" means its OPENING observation's deadline
# — the reading used below and the same one "40 of them opened at exactly
# K=3600" reads, so every figure in this comment stays internally consistent
# on one reading. Picking the block's LAST observation's deadline instead
# does NOT fail to reproduce: it is equally stable at every tolerance from 5s
# to 900s and gives "21 of 36"/"2 of 38", the figures this comment used to
# carry before round 8. The two readings differ on exactly ONE gap (acct2
# block11→12): its opening observation asks K=3600, but two later
# observations in the same block report a deadline 903s EARLIER, so OPENING
# reads that gap as -900.1s (excluded, negative) while LAST reads it as
# +3.0s (included, a lapse inside the band). Either reading sizes the
# constant identically — both put the band edge at +887s, so
# RETRY_AFTER_MARGIN_S = 900 clears it with 13s to spare under both.

      window rolls over, usage there is zeroed and the whole snapshot is
      obsolete — a later window's reset can't rescue it. So if the earliest
      known reset is already in the past, the value is untrusted outright,
      regardless of any farther-future window.
    - **age-ceiling** (``RATE_LIMIT_TRUST_MAX_AGE_S`` past ``last_good``): the
      hard client-side cap. It applies whether or not any reset is known, so
      even an all-``resets_at`` response — including a far-future or malformed
      one — is bounded, matching the ~1h stale fallback Claude Code itself uses.
      Rows with no reset info at all fall back to it alone.

    A window carrying no ``resets_at`` simply contributes no timestamp; it never
    extends trust, so partial metadata can only tighten the bound, never loosen
    it. ``models`` selects the per-model scoped windows that also gate the
    account, so their resets are considered too (matching the scheduler's view).

        # `fetchedAt` on SUCCESS only: a chain of failed blocks keeps measuring
        # trust from the first success while each block adds another full wait.

        # as a failing account and fails over. Measured: blind window 179s ->
        # 1079s, and (at a 120s tick interval, 3 unhealthy ticks) a failover
        # at +3781s that main never performs.

    # bounds is the PARK itself — how long the row can be held un-pollable —
    # not whether it is trusted at the end of it.

    # Without it BOTH arms are at risk of outliving their own trust:
    # `_classify_usage_error` (oauth.py) parses Retry-After for ANY HTTPError
    # code, not just 429, and the usage endpoint sits behind Cloudflare, which
    # emits Retry-After on 503s as routine overload signaling. Measured: a
    # `503 Retry-After: 86400` parks the row 24h, and `Retry-After: inf`
    # (Python parses "inf", "Infinity", and any overflow literal like "1e400"
    # to `float('inf')`) wedges the row permanently — `json.dumps` writes the
    # non-standard `Infinity` literal, which survives a restart.
    #
    # A PRIOR REVISION reused RETRY_AFTER_FLOOR_CAP_S (4500) for both arms,
    # reasoning "one answer to how long any ask can park a row". That is
    # wrong for the non-429 arm: `entries()` reads a non-429 row unknown once
    # TRUST_MAX_AGE_S (3600) elapses past the last success, not
    # RETRY_AFTER_FLOOR_CAP_S — so a non-429 ask above 3600 parked the row
    # 900s past its own trust: blind (un-pollable AND unknown) for that whole
    # margin. See `test_each_arm_is_bounded_by_the_ceiling_its_own_trust_uses`.

    # upstream/main ... the blind window was always 0"). That is false,
    # measured. The bound below compares the wrong pair of quantities:
    # `asked` is a DURATION measured from the FAILURE (now), but the ceiling
    # it is capped against (`RETRY_AFTER_FLOOR_CAP_S` / `TRUST_MAX_AGE_S`) is
    # an AGE measured from the last SUCCESS (`fetchedAt`), which `entries()`
    # actually uses. Those agree only when the row was already fresh (age 0)
    # at the moment it failed. On the arm measured directly below (non-429,
    # whose park cap equals the trust ceiling it is checked against) the gap
    # reduces to the row's AGE AT FAILURE, up to the whole park — but that is
    # an ARM-SPECIFIC coincidence, not the general rule: see the general
    # closed form and the 429-arm numbers further down, where cap and
    # ceiling are different constants and the identity does not hold.

    # second, independent deadline. It is not one, for two reasons.
    #
    # The clip is a no-op or it is futile, with no third case. Where
    # `trust_left >= wait` it changes nothing; where `trust_left < wait` it
    # returns `max(trust_left, computed) >= trust_left`, so the row is unknown
    # at release by construction — "still trusted at release" would need
    # `release < trust_left`, which that same expression forbids. Enumerated
    # over every positive ask and every reachable `trust_left`: 12,188,000
    # evaluations, 5,616,144 shortened a wait, 0 released with the row trusted.
    #
    # And the wait cannot move the deadline it was clipping against.
    # `entries()` decides trust from `lastGood`/`fetchedAt`, which `record()`
    # writes in the SUCCESS branch only — a 429 refreshes neither. So the
    # instant the row goes unknown is fixed by the last successful fetch, and a
    # shorter wait only samples that same instant more often, one request each.
    # Un-pollable and unknown are independent axes; the previous round treated
    # them as one window and tried to close the second by shortening the first.
    #
    # What the clip cost, measured over reset offsets 1..7200s against a 3600s
    # block (requests spent inside the block, and seconds unknown before a poll
    # could next succeed):
    #
    #     clipped     3.95 requests (worst 10)   73525s
    #     unclipped   1.00 requests (worst  1)    1406s
    #
    # Worse on both axes, because the usage endpoint's 429 is a REQUEST-RATE
    # block, not a quota-window one: `poll_policy` measured ~28-30 requests
    # per trailing hour per budget identity, where "capacity returns only as
    # old requests age out". A 5h/7d/scoped reset is a different axis and cannot lift it,
    # while every extra retry is itself a request in that trailing hour — so
    # the retries push out the very horizon they are retrying against.
