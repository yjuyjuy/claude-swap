"""Auto-switch engine: poll usage, switch accounts before they hit rate limits.

``AutoSwitchEngine`` is UI-agnostic — no printing, no argparse, no TUI
imports. It composes a :class:`ClaudeAccountSwitcher`, evaluates a threshold
policy each :meth:`~AutoSwitchEngine.tick`, and reports everything through
typed events handed to an ``on_event`` callback; the CLI renders them as
human lines or JSONL, and any future frontend (TUI dashboard, menubar) can
consume the same stream.

Policy in one paragraph: when the active account's *binding window* (the
higher of its 5h/7d utilization) crosses ``settings.threshold``, switch to
the candidate with the most headroom — proactively, so the old account is
still valid while a running Claude Code picks the new one up (this is what
makes the macOS ~30s Keychain cache latency harmless). Candidates must sit
``hysteresis_pct`` below the threshold so two accounts hovering at the line
never ping-pong, and a ``cooldown_seconds`` floor bounds the switch rate
(bypassed only when the active account is hard at its limit). Before
activation the target's token is *freshened* (refreshed if it expires within
10 minutes — twice Claude Code's refresh buffer, so a running Claude Code's
under-lock re-read sees a fresh token and aborts its own refresh); a target
whose refresh token is dead gets quarantined instead of activated. When the
active account's own usage becomes unreadable for ``unhealthy_ticks``
consecutive ticks, the engine fails over to any healthy candidate.

Cooldown and quarantine persist in ``<backup_root>/autoswitch_state.json``
(so cron-driven ``cswap auto --once`` ticks behave across processes), mutated
read-modify-write under a dedicated file lock.

# The two anti-flap thresholds are both anchored to `active_headroom`, which

# active 3.00 pts took a 0.10-pt peer over a 5.99-pt one, discarding 60x the
# runway; and inside the band monotonicity inverts, so adding headroom flips a
# move into a refusal.
#
# No single constant removes both ends — the two band widths sum to
# `active x HORIZON_HEADROOM_RATIO - SPENT_HEADROOM_PCT`, so shrinking one
# grows the other. Measured, not argued. The fix is in the ranking instead:
# `best_candidate_headroom` carries no floor, and margin failures are
# re-admitted through a one-way fallback used only when nothing else
# qualifies.

# Below this an account is spent, and headroom comparisons between two spent
# accounts compare noise (a point is under ten minutes of work, less than two

# whichever account we happen to hold.

def _recovery_is_useful(

    """Rank THIS candidate by soonest reset, rather than by headroom?

    Two clauses, one place. Deciding it from four scattered gates left
    reachable holes in four of the sixteen combinations.

    Reset wins when everything worth having is spent — below
    ``SPENT_HEADROOM_PCT`` a headroom edge is under two poll intervals, so the
    only real question is which account returns first. Asked of the active and
    the BEST candidate, not of every account: an unknown headroom is not
    evidence of an empty one, and requiring all of them let a single sentinel
    row veto the check for everybody.

    It also wins when THIS candidate is back soon. Asked per candidate, not
    once on the active: an active bound by its weekly window sits days out
    while a peer's five-hour window returns in minutes.

    Past the horizon we rank by headroom, and when no candidate meets the ratio
    nobody qualifies — an active holding more quota than any peer can offer
    should keep the work.

    THE AXIS IS A PROPERTY OF THE PAIR, not of the candidate alone, and that
    is what stops the two guards leaking into each other. Each anti-flap gate
    is one-way on its OWN axis — hysteresis on recovery, a ratio on headroom —
    but a switch swaps which account is "active". Keying the choice on the
    candidate alone flipped the axis with it, so a pair straddling the horizon
    took one gate going out and the OTHER coming back, and neither guard ever
    saw both legs:

        acct 1   8 points, reset 109h out      acct 2   3 points, reset 3.5h out
        active=1 -> candidate inside  -> recovery: 3.5h < 109h      moves
        active=2 -> candidate outside -> headroom: 8 >= 3*2         moves back

    Measured: 47 credential rewrites over 3.9h on frozen inputs, ending only
    when the sooner reset landed. ``either side inside`` is symmetric under
    that swap, so the axis survives the move and the gate that permitted the
    outbound leg is the one asked about the return — where hysteresis refuses
    it, because the account we just left is now the distant one.

    Why EITHER and not BOTH: requiring both would refuse the #202 case this
    horizon exists to preserve — a weekly-bound active sitting days out while
    a peer's five-hour window returns in eight minutes. Measured across
    multiple ticks, both rules were checked against both shapes:

        rule    oscillating pair        #202 pair
        cand    moves, moves back       moves, moves back   (the bug)
        both    never moves             never moves         (breaks #202)
        either  moves, then holds       moves, then holds   (wanted)

    The #202 case oscillated on the original code too — its test ticks once,
    so it only ever observed the outbound leg.

    The step between the two axes is NOT monotone, and an earlier version of
    this docstring claimed it was ("0 inversions"). Re-swept directly over the
    predicate — active 1..12 pts against a peer walked 0.5..40 at 0.05, four
    reset shapes — a strictly-better peer does flip a move into a refusal, and
    every case sits on one point: `peer_h` crossing SPENT_HEADROOM_PCT, where
    the spent clause goes false and the axis changes underneath the comparison.

    That is the axis boundary, not a leak, and it is NOT reachable through
    `tick()`: the fallback at the bottom of the ranking loop re-admits exactly
    those candidates. A reviewer re-took the same sweep and got a different
    count from mine, which is the point — the count depends on the sweep's step
    and reset shapes, so it is stated as WHERE rather than HOW MANY.

            one swallowed the other. The ranking cannot separate them: it sees
            only the present, and both look like an empty list. What separates
            them is WHY the ranking flipped. Traced at each leg of that walk:

                t8   1->2   left 1 holding 4.0 pts, 500h out
                t20  2->1   account 1 still 4.0 pts, still 500h out
                t22  1->2   account 2 still 2.0 pts, still 400h out

            Every return won because the ACTIVE burned down, never because the
            target recovered. So the release asks the one question the ranking
            cannot: is the account we left better than when we left it?

            ON BOTH AXES THE RANKING USES, and with the margins it already
            uses — ``SPENT_HEADROOM_PCT`` of headroom (below that an edge is
            under two poll intervals of work) or ``RECOVERY_HYSTERESIS_S``
            sooner. An account's headroom rises only when a window rolls over
            and its binding reset only moves nearer when a nearer window
            starts binding, so both are real events rather than the boundary
            crossings burn manufactures for free.

            Emptiness still decides whether to ASK. Where the bar leaves a
            real alternative it simply applies, so a fleet with somewhere else
            to go is untouched by any of this.

            Cheap: the retry runs only when the barred list came back empty,
            which is the tick that was about to do nothing anyway.

        """The account this engine most recently left, while it is still barred.

        NEVER UNDO THE PREVIOUS MOVE. Each anti-flap gate is one-way on its own
        axis, but the axis is a property of the pair's STATE and burn changes
        that state: the ratio gate is relative (`h >= active x 2`) and the
        spent gate absolute (`active <= 3.0`), so a burning pair crosses the
        boundary repeatedly and each crossing re-opens a move. Measured, both
        resets past the horizon, only the active burning: `[1, 2, 1, 2]` where
        base makes one move.

        SCOPED like every sibling gate — `at-limit` and `failover` skip the
        anti-flap gates by design. Unscoped this stranded a 2-account fleet on
        an exhausted active with the peer at 0%.

        AND SCOPED TO THE ENGINE'S OWN LANDING (`lastSwitchTo == current`).
        The bar refuses to undo THIS ENGINE'S last move; once the user
        switches by hand the engine is no longer sitting where it put itself
        and that move is already undone, so the bar protects nothing and
        merely withholds the fleet's best account. Reproduced: engine 1 -> 2,
        user 2 -> 3 by hand, account 1 on 4 pts still barred against an
        active on 2, every reset far out, no release leg reachable — the
        `not recovered` return below fires before the ratio leg is read, and
        `recovered` is False because account 1 was 4 pts at departure too.
        The engine then holds the worse account until the at-limit escape.
        Both sides are `str`-normalised: `lastSwitchTo` is a `str` from
        `_perform` and `lastSwitchFrom` an `int` from `account_ref`. A state
        record written before `lastSwitchTo` existed has no such key and
        cannot prove the engine moved away, so it KEEPS the bar — the same
        conservative reading this module gives every other missing field, and
        the only one that does not silently drop the anti-flap bound for an
        upgrade cycle.

        RELEASED when the account we left now beats us by the same ratio the
        anti-flap margin uses: that is not the flip this bars, it is a move the
        outbound leg would have made on its own merits — BUT ONLY IF IT HAS
        ACTUALLY RECOVERED. The ratio compares against the ACTIVE, and the
        active burns, so ungated it comes true on a target that has done
        nothing. Measured on the cited walk, the barred account held 4.0 pts at
        departure and 4.0 pts at every return; the ratio fired purely because
        the active fell to 2.0, which is the flap arriving through the release
        instead of through the ranking. `recovered` is that gate, computed once
        per snapshot by `_left_account_recovered` and shared with the
        leaves-nothing retry in `_rank` so the two cannot disagree.

        THE LEAVES-NOTHING RELEASE IS NOT HERE. It used to be, and it was
        rewritten twice for the same reason both times: this function cannot
        see the gates that decide. `lastSwitchFrom` is rewritten only by a
        successful switch — the one thing the bar prevents — so a bar that
        empties the ranking is permanent, and each attempt to predict emptiness
        landed one gate short of the ranking loop:

            all(n == barred ...)              "does another account EXIST"
            (headroom.get(n) or 0.0) > 0.0    "is another account not at its limit"

        The loop also applies the threshold, `h >= active x HORIZON_HEADROOM_
        RATIO`, the spent fallback's `h >= active` plus a sooner reset, and the
        recovery hysteresis. A third account on ONE point clears both
        predicates above and none of those, so the n=2 stall came back at n>=3
        and then again one point up. Measured: barred peer 3.5 pts / back in
        10h, active 2 pts / 500h out, third 1 pt — 30 ticks all BLOCKED, and
        the same fleet with `lastSwitchFrom` popped switches on the first.

        `_rank` now ASKS the ranking instead: it ranks with the bar, and
        re-ranks without it when the result is empty. That is exact by
        construction, covers the recovery axis this predicate never could, and
        cannot be one gate behind because it is not a separate copy of the
        gates.

        EMPTINESS ALONE IS NOT THE RELEASE, though — see `_rank`. At n=2 the
        barred ranking is always empty, so an emptiness-only retry is a no-op
        at exactly the fleet size the flap was reported on. Both the retry and
        the ratio above are gated on `recovered`, which is the one question the
        ranking cannot answer: is this a different account from the one we
        left, or only a different active?

        This is the release the bar needs and the ranking cannot supply. A bar
        that leaves nothing is a stall, but "leaves nothing" is also what every
        flap looks like on two accounts, so lifting on emptiness alone lifts
        always. The distinction is not in the present state — it is between the
        present and the moment of departure, which is why `_perform` records
        that moment (`leftHeadroom` / `leftRecoveryAt`) alongside
        `lastSwitchFrom`.

        Measured on the walk this guard exists for, the barred account was
        IDENTICAL at every return — same headroom, same reset — and only the
        active had changed. That is the flap: the ranking flipped underneath a
        target that did nothing.

        FAILOVER FIRST, before any leg reads the active — checked ahead of
        dominance, because dominance-first starves this branch:
        `test_a_failover_departure_does_not_disarm_the_bar` broke on its
        FIRST tick the instant the active fell far enough for `4.0 > active
        x 2` to go true (measured at active=1.8, one fifth of a point past
        the boundary this branch's own sibling test already sits on).
        A `(None, None)` snapshot means severity was genuinely unmeasured at
        departure — there is no `leftHeadroom` to diff against and never was
        — so the two signals that do not depend on the active's LIVE state
        are (1) whether the peer, right now, would itself be a healthy place
        to land: `h > 100 - settings.threshold`, the same "would the ranking
        accept this as a landing spot" test `_rank_candidates` already runs
        (`:1617`) on every candidate, reused rather than inventing a fresh
        constant; and (2), when the landing floor cannot answer, whether the
        peer's own binding reset is meaningfully sooner than the active's.
        The landing floor is the exact complement of
        `_every_account_above_threshold`, so it is UNSATISFIABLE whenever
        the
        fleet is all-spent — the recovery leg is what keeps the hold from
        becoming unconditional in exactly that regime. Neither leg can tell
        "genuinely recovered" from "was already this good" — there is
        nothing recorded to tell them apart. Measured which side the landing
        floor should land on: sweeping mutations of this same leg for the
        ordinary path showed an absolute floor is silently reintroducible
        with a green suite, so this is not free of that risk either — the
        difference is this constant is `settings.threshold`, not a
        hardcoded number, so a
        user's OWN policy decides how conservative the hold is, and it moves
        when they change it (pinned directly, below). Deliberately MORE
        conservative than the ordinary path below: a peer sitting at 4 points
        held through the whole walk that broke a bare dominance leg, with no
        upper bound short of the peer crossing the threshold itself OR its
        binding reset pulling meaningfully ahead of the active's. Bounded,
        not permanent — at-limit still escapes untouched
        (`_no_return_account` scopes this trigger out entirely), and the
        recovery leg means the bound is no longer just "the active reaches
        its own hard limit": a peer that resets first releases the hold on
        its own schedule, without the active ever needing to burn down to it.

        THE ORDINARY PATH HAS A REAL BASELINE (`leftHeadroom` is a number,
        not null), so it gets three legs, checked in this order, each with
        the margin its axis already uses. Burn cannot manufacture any of
        them: headroom rises only when a window rolls over, the ratio needs
        the active to lose more than half its remaining headroom AND clear
        an extra `SPENT_HEADROOM_PCT` on top, and the binding reset moves
        nearer only when a nearer window starts binding.

          dominance   `> active x HORIZON_HEADROOM_RATIO + SPENT_HEADROOM_PCT`
                      against the ACTIVE. A peer moved AWAY from for a reason
                      other than headroom (e.g. consume-first's reset
                      ordering) can dominate the active from the moment it
                      was left, and self-improvement against its own
                      departure baseline never fires for an account that had
                      nothing to improve on. The `+SPENT_HEADROOM_PCT` on top
                      of the bare ratio is what the bare ratio misses:
                      measured on this branch's own flap fleet (peer frozen
                      4.0 pts, active burning 98.0% -> 98.4%), it flips
                      true at active=1.8 pts purely because the active kept
                      burning; the same walk with the margin added stays
                      false through active=1.6 and only opens once the active
                      is down to a genuine sliver (`x < 0.5`), which is the
                      at-limit escape's territory, not a return worth calling
                      anti-flap. `test_a_burn_walk_never_returns_to_what_it_
                      left` still settles with the margin in place — it makes
                      the boundary harder to cross, not impossible.
          headroom    `+SPENT_HEADROOM_PCT` against the DEPARTURE baseline
                      — below that an edge is under two poll intervals, the
                      same reason the spent band exists.
          recovery    `-RECOVERY_HYSTERESIS_S` against the DEPARTURE
                      baseline — the same margin the recovery axis ranks by
                      one gate later.

        NO SNAPSHOT MEANS RELEASE. State written before this field existed, or
        by a switch that never recorded one, carries no evidence either way —
        and of the two failure modes the permanent proactive lockout is the
        worse one, because it is persisted and survives a restart and a week of
        wall clock. Absence of evidence releases. This only gates the
        proactive/consume-first return; `_no_return_account` scopes at-limit
        and failover out of the bar by design, so either trigger still
        escapes the account untouched, and the next successful switch
        overwrites the snapshot outright.

        performing.

        Stalest-first needs no rotation cursor: it reads the persisted store,

        Backoff (``backoffUntil``) is enforced by the collector even for the
        active account — a Retry-After must never be defeated — and during an
        idle-hold no candidate is polled at all (slow crawl for everything).
        Adapted cadences are persisted by the collector itself after each
        fetch (shared with every other surface), not by the engine.
